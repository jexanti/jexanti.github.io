<body> White peak distillery is a private limited company, owned by the passionate, dedicated, and resilient Max and Claire Vaughn. There are 9 employees in total. They don’t have many competitors, as big Scottish businesses aren’t on their radar. There also aren’t many online businesses to compete, as they have a unique area – not many other businesses are doing what they’re doing. Their main aim is to become a global whiskey brand, to maximise profits and to get the whiskey for sale – it takes 5 years to distil. The aims they’d like to achieve include selling 100,000 bottles in the first year, expanding the business, growing their mailing list, and gathering more sticky followers on social media. They sell whiskey, rum and gin, along with providing a tour of their distillery, and providing a temperance club (whiskey tasting). They started the business because they wanted to try something new. Max was coming to the ceiling point in his former career in accounting. He had a passion for whiskey and felt he will regret it if he didn’t start one. His mindset has contributed to the success of the business for the following reasons: resilience helped endure 5 years without selling whiskey, as it takes 5 years to distil; passion helped them sell their brand as people can see that the founders have a love for the product that they’re selling, which probably means that they’ve put a lot of time and effort into making it a high quality product; and dedication helped them start the business by allowing them to leave their old jobs, and investing a lot of their savings into the business. They say that they have interpersonal and communication skills, technical, finance and marketing skills, and negotiation skills. Their financial background helps them plan for not receiving revenue for 5 years, while they’re waiting for the whiskey to distil; their interior design skills have helped them design the interior of their shop. And their negotiation skills helped them negotiate with Selfridges in London. They convinced them to take a sample of their rum/gin to sell in store, which opened the door for when the whiskey is ready. Their proof that they’re successful includes their positive reviews, their members, the length of their mailing list, and their social media followers. The market research that they conduct includes questionnaires from their marketing team, focus groups & whiskey tasters, and governmental statistics. Their USP (unique selling point) is ‘reusing muck,’ which gives the whiskey a unique taste. They also use locally sourced ingredients from Derbyshire. The mill’s location has historic relevance, as it used to be wire works. First distillery in the peak district. They monitor their competition by watching/checking their social media, looking at their websites, and reading any media that they’re involved with/mentioned in. they compete with quality, and not price by using locally sourced ingredients from the peak district, and reusing muck. Their customers are willing to wait if their products are not in stock straight away. Their mailing list & member club is their after sales service. During the pandemic, they continued to offer tours of the distillery, just via zoom instead. They were working from home. They regularly use social media as a form of promotion for their business, by promoting upcoming events, and stating facts, or interesting things, about the business that may entice people to come along and look. They are situated at Derwent Wire Works, Matlock Rd, Ambergate, Belper DE56 2HE, but it also has a very heavy online presence, which is around as important as their physical location. The business has limited liability, which is good as if it goes bankrupt, the owners won’t have to keep selling personal possessions to make up for the debts.

Max Vaughan
Co-Founder
With a life-long passion for whisky inherited from his Dad, Max wanted to build a distillery to produce authentic English whisky and establish a destination to celebrate the craft of distilling. Seven years down the road, White Peak is established, the first whisky has come of age, and Max heads up a growing team of 12.
Max’s White Peak drink of choice is of course Wire Works Whisky, neat, full-on strength, no ice.
Claire Vaughan
Co-Founder
After 20 years as a teacher, Claire re-trained as an interior designer, whilst developing an interest and passion for whisky. She has lived and breathed the Distillery alongside Max from the outset, driving the White Peak vision of becoming Derbyshire’s very first craft Distillery. Claire takes care of the White Peak brand, packaging design and visitor experiences, alongside the many other things that come with growing a start-up business.
Claire’s favourite White Peak spirit is our Wire Works Whisky.
